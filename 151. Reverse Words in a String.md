### 151. Reverse Words in a String

##### Question

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return *a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.*

**Note** that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.



##### Solution

过于简单的medium题，先用split，reverse，最后join就行



##### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        res = s.split()
        res = res[::-1]
        res = " ".join(res)
        return res
```



##### Result
