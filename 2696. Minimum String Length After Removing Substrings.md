### 2696. Minimum String Length After Removing Substrings

##### Question

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-string-length-after-removing-substrings/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-07

You are given a string `s` consisting only of **uppercase** English letters.

You can apply some operations to this string where, in one operation, you can remove **any** occurrence of one of the substrings `"AB"` or `"CD"` from `s`.

Return *the **minimum** possible length of the resulting string that you can obtain*.

**Note** that the string concatenates after removing the substring and could produce new `"AB"` or `"CD"` substrings.



##### Solution

stack problem, use stack to save the last letter. Iterate the string, if current letter equals to `B` or `D`, check the last letter with stack[-1] to see if it is `A` or `C`.



##### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def minLength(self, s: str) -> int:
        stack = []
        res = len(s)
        if not s:
            return 0
        stack.append(s[0])
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if (stack) and ((s[i] == "B" and stack[-1] == "A") or (s[i] == "D" and stack[-1] == "C")):
                stack.pop()
                res -= 2
            else:
                stack.append(s[i])

        return res


```
